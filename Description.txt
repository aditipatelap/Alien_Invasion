- In Alien Invasion, the player controls a ship that appears at 
  the bottom center of the screen. 
- The player can move the ship right and left using the arrow keys 
  and shoot bullets using the spacebar. 
- When the game begins, a fleet of aliens fills the sky and moves across 
  and down the screen. The player shoots and destroys the aliens. 
- If the player shoots all the aliens, a new fleet appears 
  that moves faster than the previous fleet. 
- If any alien hits the player’s ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, 
  the player loses a ship. If the player loses three ships, the game ends.
